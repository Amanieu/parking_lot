## [Unreleased]

- Added per-acquisition state to `lock_api` raw locks. `RawMutex::Guard`
  replaces `GuardMarker`; rwlocks have separate `SharedGuard`, `ExclusiveGuard`,
  and `UpgradableGuard` types. Unlock operations consume this state, while
  upgrade and downgrade operations return replacement state. Bump and raw
  condition-variable waits borrow and update the state. Consuming operations
  must release their acquisition on unwind; borrowing operations must restore
  ownership and valid state, or abort if restoration fails.
- Raised the MSRV to Rust 1.95 and upgraded all crates to edition 2024.
- Removed the `hardware-lock-elision` feature.
- Removed automatic eventual fairness. Fair unlocking remains available through
  the explicit fair-unlock APIs.
- Removed the no-op `lock_api/nightly` feature.
- Removed the legacy `lock_api` `const_new` methods and the redundant
  `parking_lot` `const_*` constructor functions; the corresponding `new`
  methods can be called in constant contexts.
- Replaced the recursive read methods on `RwLock` with a dedicated reader-biased
  `RecursiveRwLock` type. The `RawRwLockRecursive` and `RawRwLockRecursiveTimed`
  extension traits have been removed from `lock_api`.
- Added `Once::new_completed` for constructing a `Once` in the completed state.
- Added `Once::{is_completed, wait, wait_force}` and the corresponding
  `OnceState` query methods.
- Made additional lock, timeout, parking, and spin-wait accessors usable in
  constant contexts.
- Added `into_inner_with_raw` to `lock_api`'s `Mutex`, `RwLock`, and `ReentrantMutex`.
- Added `RawCondvar`, `RawCondvarTimed`, and the generic `Condvar` wrapper to
  `lock_api`, and implemented `parking_lot::Condvar` using them. Custom raw
  condition variables may allow spurious wakeups; their notification methods
  must then return `false` or `0`. `parking_lot::Condvar` still guarantees no
  spurious wakeups and exact notification counts.
- Corrected the `Send` and `Sync` bounds of lock guards in `lock_api`.
- Made `RawMutex::is_locked` and `RawRwLock::{is_locked, is_locked_exclusive}` required methods.
- Renamed `MappedRwLockReadGuard::try_map_or_else` to `try_map_or_err`.
- Clarified the safety requirements of raw lock implementations, including
  acquire/release synchronization, moving or dropping a locked raw lock,
  preserving the original lock mode on a failed upgrade, and stable thread IDs.
  Acquisitions may unwind without leaving a new acquisition held; consuming
  guard operations release their acquisition on unwind, while bump and wait
  operations must restore ownership or abort.
- Clarified the aliasing requirements of unsafe raw-access, force-unlock, and
  guard-construction APIs in `lock_api`.
- Guard `unlocked` and `unlocked_fair` operations now abort if re-locking panics.
  Default raw-lock bump implementations also abort if re-locking panics.
- Guard `with_upgraded` operations abort if raw upgrading or downgrading panics,
  preserving continuous lock ownership.
- Parking-lot operations in `parking_lot_core` are now guaranteed to never
  unwind.
- Documented that parking-lot-based synchronization primitives must not be used
  internally by global allocators.
- Fixed `unlock_upgradable_fair` not forcing a fair handoff.
- Fixed conditional `Condvar` waits reporting a timeout without rechecking the predicate.
- Fixed the generic thread parker continuously busy-spinning while parked.
- Fixed timed waits on ESP-IDF using the wrong clock.
- Made timed waits on Apple platforms independent of wall-clock changes.
- Fixed the futex timeout ABI on 32-bit Linux targets, including time64-only
  architectures, with fallback to time32 when the kernel lacks time64 support.
- Corrected `RwLock` deadlock tracking to avoid false positives and missed
  cycles, and prevented dependency feature unification from enabling tracking
  when only `parking_lot_core/deadlock_detection` is enabled.
- Added `Once` deadlock tracking and made overlapping wait cycles report as a
  single component.

## parking_lot 0.6.0 (2018-06-08)

This release moves most of the code for type-safe `Mutex` and `RwLock` types
into a separate crate called `lock_api`. This new crate is compatible with
`no_std` and provides `Mutex` and `RwLock` type-safe wrapper types from a raw
mutex type which implements the `RawMutex` or `RawRwLock` trait. The API
provided by the wrapper types can be extended by implementing more traits on
the raw mutex type which provide more functionality (e.g. `RawMutexTimed`). See
the crate documentation for more details.

There are also several major changes:

- The minimum required Rust version is bumped to 1.26.
- All methods on `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) are no longer inherent
  methods and must be called as `MutexGuard::method(self)`. This avoids
  conflicts with methods from the inner type.
- `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `unlocked` method which
  temporarily unlocks a mutex, runs the given closure, and then re-locks the
   mutex.
- `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `bump` method which gives a
  chance for other threads to acquire the mutex by temporarily unlocking it and
  re-locking it. However this is optimized for the common case where there are
  no threads waiting on the lock, in which case no unlocking is performed.
- `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `map` method which returns a
  `MappedMutexGuard` which holds only a subset of the original locked type. The
  `MappedMutexGuard` type is identical to `MutexGuard` except that it does not
  support the `unlocked` and `bump` methods, and can't be used with `CondVar`.
